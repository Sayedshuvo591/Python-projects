#Text to speech converter


'''
There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in python. One of such APIs is the Google

Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API. gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the

text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file.The gTTS API supports several languages including

English, Hindi, Tamil, French, German and many more. The speech can be delivered in any one of the two available

audio speeds, fast or slow. However, as of the latest update, it is not possible to change the voice of the generated audio.

#At first check the python version "python --version" and pip version "pip --version" in cmd and then install gtts "pip install gtts" in  cmd


# Import the Gtts module for text

# to speech conversion

from gtts import gTTS

# This module is imported so that we can 
 
# play the converted audio 

import os

fh = open("test.txt", "r")

myText = fh.read().replace("\n", " ")

# Language we want to use

language = 'en'

# Passing the text and language to the engine,
  
# here we have marked slow=False. Which tells
  
# the module that the converted audio should
  
# have a high speed 

output = gTTS(text=myText, lang=language, slow=False)

# Saving the converted audio in a mp3 file named 

output.save("output.mp3")

fh.close()

# Play the converted file

os.system("start output.mp3")

#for run it go to terminal and type "python the file name with .py extention"
